# Conditions:

All expeirments share the same codebase and are run with different `treatment` parameters in the Empirica interface.

## Experiment 1

Our first experiment used a `unidirectional` message channel and had two conditions:

```
experiment1-0.7
experiment1-0.3
```

corresponding to different ground-truth probabilities.

## Experiment 2

Our second experiment manipulated the message channel:

```
experiment2-slider
experiment2-chat
```
