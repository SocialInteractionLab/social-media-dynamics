# Distributed Statistical Inference in Social Networks

This repository contains code, data, and analyses for experiments examining how communication modality affects collective inference in small social networks.

## Overview

Participants in groups of 4 estimated an underlying probability distribution based on limited private observations, then exchanged information through different communication channels (slider-only, unidirectional messaging, or interactive chat). We manipulated information quality along multiple dimensions to examine when natural language communication becomes critical for aggregation.

## Repository Structure

### `/experiments`
[Empirica](https://empirica.ly/) experiment code for the web-based platform (client and server).

### `/data`
Experimental data organized by experiment (exp1, exp2) with raw Empirica exports and merged datasets.

### `/analysis`
Analysis scripts and notebooks (R/Quarto) for each experiment and combined analyses.

### `/figures`
Publication-ready figures (PDF).

### `/stimuli`
Game generation scripts for Experiment 2 stimuli. See `stimuli/README.md` for details.

### `/models`
Computational models of collective inference (DeGroot, count-based models).
